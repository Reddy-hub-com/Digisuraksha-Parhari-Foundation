Digisuraksha Cybersecurity Internship – 8-Week Hands-On Journey (2025)
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the 8-week practical cybersecurity internship experience. This program emphasized real-world cybersecurity challenges with a focus on offensive security, threat detection, and incident response. Each week involved targeted exercises based on frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP, and MISP, helping bridge academic knowledge with industry standards.

📆 Weekly Progress Overview
🔹 Week 1: MITRE TTP Mapping & Threat Classification
Mapped APT group behavior using the MITRE ATT&CK framework

Wrote and validated custom YARA rules for threat detection

Exported threat indicators to MISP for threat intel sharing

Documented all procedures with screenshots and logs

🔹 Week 2: Malware Analysis & IOC Extraction (APT28)
Studied APT28 threat actor and gathered related IOCs

Analyzed malware artifacts using HybridAnalysis

Correlated IOCs in MISP for enrichment and validation

Referred to open-source threat reports for reference

🔹 Week 3: Linux Privilege Escalation Practice
Completed OverTheWire Bandit for Linux basics

Practiced Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) techniques

Developed a hands-on LPE cheat sheet with real-world examples

🔹 Week 4: OSINT & Reconnaissance Operations
Performed metadata scraping and image geolocation analysis

Utilized popular OSINT tools for passive intelligence gathering

Tools used: theHarvester, Maltego, SpiderFoot, etc.

🔹 Week 5: Web Application Exploitation
Discovered and exploited key web vulnerabilities:

✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

✅ SQL Injection (SQLi)

✅ Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Used Burp Suite for testing and payload crafting

Investigated web server logs to detect exploitation traces

🔹 Week 6: Exploiting Vulnerable Virtual Machines
Performed CTF challenges on:

🖥️ Mr. Robot VM

🧠 DC-1 VM

Conducted full walkthroughs from enumeration to root privilege gain

🔹 Week 7: Log Analysis & Incident Response
Utilized Graylog for log-based threat hunting

Built a timeline of simulated attacks based on log artifacts

Drafted a structured Incident Response (IR) checklist and reporting format

🔹 Week 8: Report Compilation & Submission
Consolidated all weekly tasks into a final detailed internship report

Peer-reviewed documentation for accuracy

Organized the GitHub repository for clear navigation and public presentation
